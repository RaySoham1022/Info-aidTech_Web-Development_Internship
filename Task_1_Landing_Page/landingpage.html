        <h1>Indian Rail Locomotives</h1>
        <p style="color: black;">The Indian Railways primarily operates a fleet of electric and diesel locomotives,
            along with several
            compressed natural gas (CNG) locomotives. Steam locomotives are operated on a few World Heritage Sites and
            also run occasionally as heritage trains. A locomotive is also known as a loco or more popularly as an
            engine. The country's first steam locomotive ran on the Red Hill Railway (built by Arthur Cotton to
            transport granite for road-building) from Red Hills to the Chintadripet bridge in Madras in 1837.

                    outstanding example of Victorian Gothic Revival architecture in India, blended with themes deriving
                    from Indian traditional architecture. The building, designed by the British architect F. W. Stevens,
                    became the symbol of Bombay as the â€˜Gothic Cityâ€™ and the major international mercantile port of
                    India. The terminal was built over 10 years, starting in 1878, according to a High Victorian Gothic
                    design based on late medieval Italian models. Its remarkable stone dome, turrets, pointed arches and
                    eccentric ground plan are close to traditional Indian palace architecture.</p>
